# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository is for the coursera course "getting and cleaning data" project.
The main idea of this project is to create a script that does the following

1 Downloads the datasets
2 Combines the datasets
3 Extracts the required columns from the set
4 Adds activities and individual level subject data into the dataset
5 Summarizes the data and presents a finished probject

The script to achieve this is titled run_analysis.R
The codebook for further information on the variables can also be found
The resulting analysis has been uploaded and is titled "tidy_data.txt"
